01. Handling of Thermal Receipts as a Source of Exposure to Bisphenol A
02. 1  and neurodevelopment in children exposed perinatally. 2  Exposure to BPA is primarily through dietary ingestion, including consumption of canned foods. 3  A less-studied source of exposure is thermal receipt paper, 4  handled daily by many people at supermarkets, ATM machines, gas stations, and other settings. We hypothesized that handling of thermal receipts significantly increases BPA exposure, but use of gloves during handling minimizes exposure.

08. All participants provided a spot urine sample, collected in a sterile BPA-free polypropylene specimen cup, immediately before handling of receipts and 4 hours later. Volunteers provided additional sequential urine samples at 8, 12, and 24 hours after handling of receipts without gloves. Urinary-specific gravity was measured using a handheld refractometer. Urine was stored in polypropylene cryogenic vials at or below −20°C until analysis. Total (free plus conjugated species) urinary BPA concentration was measured at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using published methods. 1

13. In this pilot study, we observed an increase in urinary BPA concentrations after continuously handling receipts for 2 hours without gloves, but no significant increase when using gloves. The peak level (5.8 µg/L) was lower than that observed after canned soup consumption (20.8µg/L).
14. Concentrations of BPA were adjusted for specific gravity to account for urine dilution.
15. Using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc), mixed regression models were used to examine associations between log-transformed specific gravity–adjusted urinary BPA concentrations for prehandling and posthandling samples and across time points for those who provided sequential urine samples. Statistical significance was set at a P ≤ .05 (2-sided test).

17. Results
18. Twenty-four volunteers (mean age [SD], 35 [12] years) provided at least 2 urine samples for the simulation without gloves; 12 volunteers provided additional sequential samples and 12 also completed the simulation with gloves (Table). We excluded 1 participant for reporting consumption of 4 cans of beverage prior to the simulation (baseline urinary BPA concentration of 49.3 µg/L vs <2 µg/L for the remaining participants, decreasing to 12.0 µg/L postsimulation).
19. We detected BPA in 83% (n = 20) of samples at baseline and in 100% of samples after handling receipts without gloves. The geometric mean urinary BPA concentration was 1.8 µg/L (95% CI, 1.3–2.4 µg/L) before simulation and 5.8 µg/L (95% CI, 4.0–8.4 µg/L) postsimulation (P = .005 for interaction between presimulation and postsimulation BPA and glove status). The geometric mean BPA urinary concentrations from 12 participants who provided sequential samples following receipt handling without gloves were 2.1 µg/L (95% CI, 1.4–3.3 µg/L) at baseline, 6.0 µg/L (95% CI, 3.4–10.7 µg/L) at 4 hours, 11.1 µg/L (95% CI, 5.5–22.8 µg/L) at 8 hours, 10.5 µg/L (95%CI, 4.9–22.6 µg/L) at 12 hours, and 4.7 µg/L (95%CI, 2.4–9.1 µg/L) at 24 hours. Each measure was significantly different from baseline (P < .001 for 4-hour, 8-hour, and 12-hour urine samples and P = .04 for 24-hour samples). We observed no significant increase in urinary BPA after handling receipts with gloves (Figure).

24. Limitations include the small volunteer sample and loss of participants in the second simulation. However, urinary BPA concentrations at baseline were similar in the full and smaller groups and similar to the US population (1.83 µg/L). 6  A larger study is needed to confirm our findings and evaluate the clinical implications.
