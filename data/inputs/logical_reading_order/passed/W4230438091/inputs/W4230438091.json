For true smiles, the photographer encouraged the activation of muscles around the eye (e.g., by attempting to make participants laugh). For false smiles, photo subjects were instructed to smile with their mouths while maintaining neutral eyes. Using Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA), all photographs were cropped to create oval images that focused on facial features and excluded the target’s hair. In keeping with past work (Kawakami et al., 2014), photographs were grey-scaled, standardized for size (360 × 450 pixels), and the mean luminance (brightness) was set within a restricted range of 187.46 to 188.68 pixels per intensity level.

In particular, he\/she suggested the possibility that Black targets expressing false smiles might have more dilated pupils than the other target categories, presenting an alternative explanation for some of the results. To investigate this possibility, the photographs were printed and a research assistant, masked to condition and study purpose, measured the ratio of pupil to iris for each stimulus using a ruler—to get an objective measure of pupil dilation. The research assistant reported that because the images were initially grayscaled before they were presented to participants, eye contrast was often obscured and she was unable to accurately measure the eyes of many of the stimuli. This finding suggests that even if pupil differences were present, they were unlikely to affect participants’ responses. ",
