This image is an aerial photograph of a residential area along the shoreline of Stuart, Florida, showing a large, vivid green algal bloom in the water. The algal bloom spreads across a significant portion of the water surface, creating a stark contrast with the dark blue of the unaffected water. Several houses with lush green lawns and palm trees are visible along the coast, with private docks extending into the water.
