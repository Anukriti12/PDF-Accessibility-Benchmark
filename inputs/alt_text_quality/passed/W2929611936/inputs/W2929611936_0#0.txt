A graph titled "Time-dependent analysis results" compares two analysis methods for detecting time-dependent signals at the coordinates of TXS 0506+056 over a time period from 2009 to 2017. The x-axis represents the observation time in years, and the y-axis represents the -log10(p) values indicating significance. Two curves are displayed: the orange curve represents the Gaussian-shaped time profile analysis, and the blue curve represents the box-shaped time profile analysis. Peaks in both curves indicate the most significant excesses during each data-taking period. A large shaded blue band around 2015 highlights the best-fitting 158-day time window for the box-shaped analysis, while the dotted vertical line marks the time of the IceCube-170922A event. The Gaussian curve shows a smoother, broader profile, while the box-shaped curve shows a sharp peak centered around the same period.
