A line graph showing the time-independent weight of individual events observed during the IC86b period. The x-axis displays time in Modified Julian Date (MJD) and calendar years (2012â€“2015), while the y-axis shows the log10 of event weights. Vertical lines represent individual observed events, with line heights indicating the event weights. The dashed curve shows the best-fit Gaussian time window, and the solid bracket indicates the best-fit box-shaped time window. The colors of the lines represent approximate muon energy proxies, with blue indicating higher energy events and black representing lower energy events.
