A detailed specification curve analysis showing the association between years of education and risk preference. The figure has two main sections: the top section displays a line graph titled "Specification curve" and the bottom section titled "Specification panel" summarizes the independent and dependent variables used in the analysis.

Top Section (Specification Curve):
The x-axis represents different model specifications numbered from 1 to 4352.
The y-axis represents the effect size of years of education on risk preference, ranging from -0.50 to 0.50.
The curve shows a downward trend from positive effect sizes on the left to near-zero and slightly negative values on the right.
Shaded confidence intervals surround the curve, indicating statistical uncertainty for each model.
Two curves are highlighted: one for the best fit: box specification and one for the best fit: Gaussian specification.

Bottom Section (Specification Panel):
A heatmap with rows and columns represents the inclusion of independent variables, dependent variables, and other model parameters across specifications.
Independent variables include household income, sex, age, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, employment status, and time use (social and sports).
Dependent variables include general, driving, investment, health, and risky choices under different measures (e.g., DFE1, DFE2, DFD1).
Purple horizontal lines indicate the presence of variables in each specification, while gray shading separates groups of dependent variables.
