04. The XRD patterns are shown in Figure 1a. All the diffraction peaks can be assigned to a pure rhombohedral phase of BiFeO3 with a space group of R3c and a point group 3m (JCPDS Card no. 86-1518). In Figure 1b, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shows the existence of Bi (8.27%), Fe (7.37%), O (67.74%), Al (15.40%) and Au (1.25%), where Al and Au come from the sample holder and the sputtered Au coating on the powder sample, respectively. XPS was used to investigate the oxidation states of the Bi and Fe elements in BiFeO3. Figure 1c is the high resolution XPS spectrum of Fe 2p, showing the binding energy of 711.02 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and 725.27 eV for Fe 2p1/2 with a spin orbit splitting of 14.25 eV, which were characteristic for Fe3+.[15] The high resolution XPS spectrum of Bi 4f (Figure 1d) shows two peaks around 159.22 and 164.47 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of the Bi3+ state, respectively.[16] Figure S1a is a schematic diagram displaying the circuit for the P-E hysteresis loop measurement. A well-developed P-E loop can be observed in Figure S1b, indicating the ferroelectric nature of BiFeO3. The saturation polarization is achieved at an applied electric field of 5.0 kV·mm-1.
05. The piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 nanosheets was characterized by a piezoresponse force microscope (PFM), using dual alternating current resonance tracking (DART) modes in order to expel the displacement contribution from electrostatic interaction and topographical crosstalk in mapping the local electromechanical properties. The topographic, vertical piezoresponse amplitude, and phase images of the BiFeO3 nanosheets are shown in Figure 3a-3c, respectively. The BiFeO3 nanosheets can be clearly detected in the topographic image with clear contrasts in the amplitude and phase images. A localized hysteresis loop is observed (Figure 3d), where the phase angle changes by 160° under the reversal of 90 V direct current (DC) bias field, confirming the piezoelectricity of the BiFeO3 nanosheets.

07. The SEM and TEM micrographs are shown in Figure 2a and 2b, respectively. The as-prepared BiFeO3 catalyst possesses a morphology of square nanosheet with an average size of ~380 nm. Size distribution of the BiFeO3 nanosheets is shown in Figure S2. The selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) is shown in the inset of Figure 2b, indicating the normal direction of BiFeO3 nanosheet being along [001]pc (The subscript “pc” refers to a “pseudo-cubic” structure adopted here for easy indexing). The high resolution TEM image (Figure 2c) of the nanosheet shows two characteristic lattice spacings, both around 0.395 nm, which agree well the d-spacings of the (100)pc and (010)pc planes of BiFeO3. Furthermore, the scanning TEM image and the associated elemental mappings of Bi, Fe and O (Figure 2d) show uniform distributions of these elements.
08. The basic principle of piezo-catalysis is shown in Figure 4a-b. BiFeO3 nanosheet with a rhombohedral phase is piezoelectric due to the non-central symmetry of its 3m point group. When subjected to

14. where T3 is the applied stress in the normal direction of the nanosheet, d33 is the piezoelectric moduli, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative permittivity in the normal direction and w3 is the thickness of the piezoelectric nanosheet. The applied stress T3, d33, εr of the BiFeO3 nanosheets in the current study are estimated to be about 1.01×105 kPa, 100 pm/V, and 26, respectively. [9a,9b,18,19] The thickness of the piezoelectric nanosheet is characterized to be 20 nm according to Atomic force microscopy (AFM) image in Figure S5. The calculated open-circuit voltage across the BiFeO3 nanosheet is about 0.88 V. Based on a rough estimation, the tilting of CB results in the band edge to be lifted up at the negatively charged side, slightly more negative than the H2/H2O redox potential (0 V) for HER. Thus, the piezo-catalytic hydrogen generation of water can be realized on pure BiFeO3 material.

16. as 8344 kg/m3, the resonance frequency of BiFeO3 nanosheet is estimated to be around 46.5 kHz. This result confirms that the highest piezo-catalytic hydrogen generation can be obtained at the resonance frequency of a piezoelectric material (Figure
17. Figure 5a shows the piezo-catalytic hydrogen generation result, where the total hydrogen production per gram of catalyst under the vibration power of 100 W for 1 hour is up to 20.4, 124.1, and 8.3 μmol at the frequency of 28, 45, and 100 kHz, respectively. The 1st-order resonance frequency (f r ) of BiFeO3 square nanosheet can be estimated by the following equation,[20]
18. mechanical vibration, the thin BiFeO3 nanosheet will easily bend. Due to the piezoelectric effect, lots of positive and negative charges will be generated on the catalyst’s surface. The negative electric charges (q-) generated on the BiFeO3 nanosheets’ surfaces will effectively attract the dissociated hydrogen ions in the water to produce H2. Meanwhile, the positive charges (q+) accumulated on the other side of the BiFeO3 nanosheets will be consumed by the sacrificial agents (SO32-).[17] It should be mentioned that the bandgap of our synthesized BiFeO3 is about 2.27 eV and the flat band potential is 0.32 V vs. RHE, as shown in Figure S3. As shown in Figure 4c, the holes generated on the top of valence band (VB) are often energetically favorable for the oxidation of various organic pollutants.[6,7] However, the electrons generated on the bottom of conduction band (CB) is not energetically favorable for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Photo-catalytic hydrogen production experiment was conducted to verify that photocatalytic hydrogen generation cannot be achieved by using the synthesized BiFeO3 nanosheets (Figure S4). We show here that the piezoelectric induced internal electric field can tilt the CB and enable the catalytic HER. Under the mechanical deformation of piezoelectric BiFeO3 nanosheets, the open-circuit voltage (Vp) created across the two surfaces of a nanosheet can be calculated as: [12]
19. Equation (1) further implies that the piezo-catalysis can be easily tuned by variation of nanoparticle geometry and materials properties.

22. where L, W, ρ, and D are the length, width, density, and bending rigidity of the nanosheet, respectively. The bending rigidity D is defined as,
23. The stability of the BiFeO3 nanosheets after 60 min piezo-catalysis can be reflected from the XRD patterns (Figure S6) taken before and after the piezo-catalysis, which are quite similar to each other and no secondary phases can be detected. After piezo-catalysis for 60 mins, a number of cracked nanosheets (Figure S7) were generated due to the high power (100 W) of the ultrasonic machine used. Working at the resonant frequency is another reason that the BiFeO3 nanosheets are easily cracked. This result agrees well with the experimental result (Figure 5) that the hydrogen production rate decreases with increasing reaction time. Decreasing the ultrasound power and tuning the frequency away from resonance will reduce the number of cracked nanosheets. To minimize the effect of temperature on piezo-catalysis, the water in the ultrasonic bath was changed every 20 min. As shown in Figure S8, water temperature change rate was 0.33 °C min−1. The temperature variation was controlled to be below 4 °C.

30. Figure 5b shows the influence of vibration power on hydrogen production. For 1 h mechanical vibration at a frequency of 45 kHz, the hydrogen production of BiFeO3 nanosheet is about 26.1 μmol·g-1 under the vibration power of 50 W, which is much lower than that under the vibration power of 100 W. The relationship between the piezoelectric charges (Q) per unit area on the BiFeO3 nanosheet surface, the piezoelectric coefficient (d), and the external stress (T) can be described as Q=d·T. Higher vibration power can lead to higher stress T, which induces more piezoelectric charges on the catalyst’s surface, resulting in higher hydrogen production rate. Without the catalyst, almost no hydrogen can be generated under the vibration power of 100 W (Figure 5b). It should be noted that although the charge carriers in BiFeO3 are localized and tightly bound,[22] the piezo-generated electrons and holes will be recombined due to conduction across the small nanosheet thickness or vanished due to the quick relaxation of mechanical stress. To suppress the rapid recombination or vanish of the piezoelectrically induced positive and negative charges and increase the lifetime of the negative charges for hydrogen generation, Na2SO3 sacrificial agent was used to effectively scavenge the positive charges, similar to what is usually done in photocatalytic hydrogen generation.
